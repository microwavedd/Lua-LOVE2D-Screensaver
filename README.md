A simple screensaver made using lua and LOVE, both the game engine and the noun.

It consists of a ball/Image floating around the screen, really simple.


You need LOVE to make this work. To download it, download LOVE in https://love2d.org.
To use it, create either a shortcut in your desktop and drag the whole folder to the shortcut to it, or download the visual studio code https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pixelbyte-studios.pixelbyte-love2d extension, and press Alt + L inside the lua file.

Also, you can change the image to whatever you like, as well as the resolution and the speed of the ball. All of this is commentes inside the script and it's very easy to change.
